			<p> Hello, I am going to show my first assignment here. This assignment is about the html tags, some of which are listed below: </p>


			<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="9">
				<tr style="background-color: #F3D493; font-size: 20px; color: #22170D;">
					<th> SN </th>
					<th> Tag Name </th>
					<th> Description </th>
					<th> Example </th>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td> 01 </td>
					<td> Video Tag </td>
					<td> This element, which adds native video playback support to the HTML specification in HTML5, can be used to embed a video in an HTML document. Add the video URL to the element by using either the src attribute of the < video > element or by nesting one or more < source > elements between the opening and closing < video > tags. </td>
					<td> < video > </td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td> 02 </td>
					<td> Time Tag </td>
					<td> This element defines a datetime. The content of a time element is typically a human-readable date and time, and a machine-readable version of the same time is placed in the datetime attribute. </td>
					<td> < time > </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 03 </td>
					<td> Quote Tag </td>
					<td> This element is used to identify and inline quote that does not require paragraph breaks. Longer quotations that do require paragraph breaks should use the < blockquote > element. </td>
					<td> < q >  </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 04 </td>
					<td> Navigation Tag </td>
					<td> This element identifies a group of navigation links. Links in a  < nav > element may point to other webpages or to different sections of the same webpage. </td>
					<td> < nav > </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 05 </td>
					<td> Main Tag </td>
					<td> This element is used to denote the content of a webpage that relates to the central topic of that page or application.

					<td> < main > </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 06 </td>
					<td> Header Tag </td>
					<td> This element is used to identify content that precedes the primary content of the web page and often contains website branding, navigation elements, search forms, and similar content that is duplicated across all or most pages of a website </td>
					<td> < header > </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 07 </td>
					<td> Footer Tag </td>
					<td> This element is a structural element used to identify the footer of a page, document, article, or section. A < footer > typically contains copyright and authorship information or navigational elements pertaining to the contents of the parent element. </td>
					<td> < footer > </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 08 </td>
					<td> Figure Tag </td>
					<td> This element identifies self-contained content related to the main content, such as an image, table, or chart. The < figcaption > element is often nested within a < figure > element to add a caption to the content identified by the < figure > tags. </td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 09 </td>
					<td> Audio Tag </td>
					<td> This element is used to add audio media resources to an HTML document that will be played by native support for audio playback built into the browser rather than a browser plugin. </td>

					<td> < track > </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 12 </td>
					<td> Table Footer Tag </td>
					<td> The < tfoot> element identifies one or more < tr> elements as containing summary contents of a table's columns. The < tfoot> element must be the direct descendant of a < table> element.

					<td> < tfoot > </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 13 </td>
					<td> Table Body Tag </td>
					<td> The < tbody> element must be a direct descendant of a < table> element and is used to identify < tr> elements that comprise the body of the table. The < tbody> element should always come after a < thead> element and may come before or after a < tfoot> element. </td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 14 </td>
					<td> Summary Tag </td>

					<td> 18 </td>
					<td> Dialog Tag </td>

					<td> 24 </td>
					<td> Teletype Tag </td>
					<td> The < tt> element was used to identify text to be displayed using the browser's default monospace or fixed-width font as it would appear on a fixed-width device such as a teletype.

					<td> < tt > </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 25 </td>

				<tr>
					<td> 45 </td>
					<td> Audio Tag </td>
					<td> The < sound> element was used in the Mosaic browser to add sound files to HTML documents. It was never formally adopted in an HTML standard and has no support among modern browsers. Instead, use the modern HTML5 element < audio>. </td>
					<td> < sound > </td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td> 46 </td>
